## 🧠 My Story
While I deeply enjoy the structured logic of IT, databases, and clean code, my world isn't limited to keyboards and commit histories. Outside the digital space, I find balance in two very different, yet equally grounding passions: gardening and billiards.

Gardening is my quiet escape. There’s something deeply rewarding about nurturing life—from the vibrant bloom of sunflowers to the soothing scent of lavender. It’s a chance to unplug, slow down, and reconnect with nature.

Then there’s billiards—my way of staying sharp in a different way. The strategy, focus, and rhythm of the game offer a great mental reset and a bit of friendly competition never hurts.

These hobbies aren’t just pastimes—they’re how I recharge, reset, and stay grounded. Whether it's tending a garden or lining up a perfect shot, they bring clarity and calm to balance the high focus of my work in tech.
